# 🤖 The Agent Intelligence Toolkit (.specify)

This directory contains the custom **Agent Skills** and **Subagent Framework** that powered the creation of this project.

## 📁 Framework Components

| Directory | Type | Description |
|:---|:---|:---|
| `scripts/` | **Automation** | Bash and Python scripts for recursive project updates. |
| `templates/` | **Standards** | Blueprints for PHRs, ADRs, and Chapter Formatting. |
| `memory/` | **Constitution** | The "Project Rules" that ensure consistent quality across all agents. |

## 🛠️ Integrated Skills
These are not just scripts—they are **Intelligent Behaviors** invoked by Claude Code:
*   **SDD Management**: Formalizing specifications into actionable plans.
*   **Reality Validation**: Checking technical content against 2025 technology standards.
*   **Bridge Logic**: Managing the connection between "Workstation" training and "Edge" deployment docs.
