# 📚 The Physical AI Knowledge Base

This directory contains the core educational intelligence of the project. It is structured as a recursive sequence of modules that take a developer from fundamental physics to integrated humanoid embodiment.

## 📁 Folder Structure

| Folder | Stage | Description |
|:---|:---|:---|
| `intro/` | **The Hook** | Narrative gateways that set the mission for each module. |
| `M1/` | **The Spine** | Foundations of ROS 2 and hardware workstations. |
| `M2/` | **The Hallucination** | Simulation, Digital Twins, and Synthetic Data. |
| `M3/` | **The Awakening** | Isaac ROS perception and world models. |
| `M4/` | **The Embodiment** | VLA Fusion and final system integration. |
