# 🦾 Module 1: The Nervous System

> "The first step in building a god is building a spine." — *Anonymous Robotics Engineer*

### ⚡ The Mission
Welcome to the foundation. In this module, you are not just learning "ROS 2" or "Hardware." You are building the **Nervous System** of a humanoid being.

You will transition from a consumer of technology to a **Creator of Embodied Intelligence**.

### 🧬 What’s at Stake?
Without a nervous system, the most advanced AI is just a "brain in a jar." To make an AI **Physical**, it must feel, it must react, and it must move with sub-millisecond precision.

**In this Season, you will conquer:**
1.  **The Forge:** Setting up a world-class workstation that can handle 2025-standard simulations.
2.  **The Spine:** Assembling the Jetson Thor Edge Kit—the literal "vertebrae" of your robot.
3.  **The Language:** Mastering ROS 2 Kilted Kaiju, the protocol that allows sensors to talk to motors.
4.  **The Body:** Drafting your first URDF (Unified Robot Description Format)—the digital DNA of your humanoid.

### 🏆 The Milestone
By the end of this module, you will have a workstation that breathes, a Jetson that thinks, and a digital body that is ready to be born into simulation.

**Are you ready to build the spine?**
