# Capstone Assessment Rubric

This capstone section provides a comprehensive assessment rubric for evaluating student work on the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics capstone project. The rubric covers all learning objectives from Module 4 and provides clear criteria for grading.

Use this rubric to assess student submissions and provide constructive feedback for improvement.

## Prerequisites

Before using this rubric, you should have:
- Completed all Module 4 capstone sections (S1-S5)
- Implemented the voice-to-plan-to-execute pipeline
- Run simulation tests and collected performance metrics
- Optionally completed physical deployment (S5)

## Learning Objectives

| Level | Objective |
|-------|-----------|
| **[Beginner]** | Understand the grading criteria for capstone evaluation |
| **[Beginner]** | Identify which rubric categories apply to each component |
| **[Intermediate]** | Self-assess work against the detailed rubric criteria |
| **[Intermediate]** | Identify areas needing improvement before submission |
| **[Advanced]** | Achieve excellent ratings across all rubric categories |
| **[Advanced]** | Exceed expectations with bonus challenges and extensions |

## Key Concepts

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Rubric** | A scoring guide with criteria and performance levels |
| **System Integration** | How well the Voice, Plan, Execute, Recover stages work together |
| **Code Quality** | Organization, documentation, testing, and best practices |
| **Performance Metrics** | Quantitative measures like latency, accuracy, success rate |
| **Self-Assessment** | Evaluating your own work against objective criteria |

## Assessment Overview

### Grading Categories

The capstone is assessed across four major categories:

| Category | Weight | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| System Integration | 30% | How well components work together |
| Code Quality | 25% | Code organization, documentation, testing |
| Performance | 25% | System performance metrics and benchmarks |
| Documentation | 20% | Project documentation and presentation |

### Grade Scale

| Grade | Percentage | Performance Level |
|-------|------------|-------------------|
| A | 90-100% | Excellent - Exceeds expectations |
| B | 80-89% | Good - Meets all requirements |
| C | 70-79% | Satisfactory - Meets basic requirements |
| D | 60-69% | Needs Improvement - Partial requirements |
| F | &lt;60% | Does not meet requirements |
