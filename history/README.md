# 📜 The Intelligence Audit Trail

This directory houses the metadata and evolutionary history of the **Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics** project. It serves as the "Source of Truth" for how architectural decisions were reached.

## 📁 Historical Artifacts

| Directory | Type | Purpose |
|:---|:---|:---|
| `prompts/` | **PHR** | Prompt History Records of every single agent interaction. |
| `state/` | **Sync** | Global session history and conversation state management. |
| `adr/` | **Decisions** | Formal Architecture Decision Records for significant codebase shifts. |

## 🏗️ Why This Matters
Maintaining a verbose history allows for:
1.  **Traceability**: Understanding the "Why" behind 2025 tech stack choices.
2.  **Context Resumption**: Allowing multiple agents or developers to pick up exactly where the last session left off.
3.  **Human-Agent Synergy**: Documenting the specific collaboration between Junaid and Claude Code.
