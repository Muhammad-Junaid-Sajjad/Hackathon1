## Prompt

--title "Complete Module 3 Chapter 1" --stage general

## Response snapshot

Completed writing all 7 sections of Module 3 Chapter 1 covering NVIDIA Omniverse and Isaac Sim fundamentals for humanoid robotics simulation.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Completed comprehensive documentation covering Omniverse installation, USD format, simulation loop, GPU physics, PhysX 5 integration, sensor simulation, and Isaac Gym APIs for humanoid robotics
- 🧪 Tests: none
- 📁 Files: Created 7 markdown documentation files (M3/C1/S1-S7) totaling approximately 5,500+ lines of content with working Python code examples
- 🔁 Next prompts: Continue to Module 3 Chapter 2 (Robot Models and Assets), Module 3 Chapter 3 (Control and Planning)
- 🧠 Reflection: The sequential writing approach ensured complete coverage of the Isaac Sim ecosystem from installation through advanced RL training

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None - all sections completed successfully
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS - all 7 sections written, placeholder files updated
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Consider batch verification of documentation structure after completing multiple chapters
