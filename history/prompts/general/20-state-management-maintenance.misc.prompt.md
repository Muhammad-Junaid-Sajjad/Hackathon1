## Prompt

Update the state.md file to reflect the final completion of the alignment session.

## Response snapshot

Finalized `history/state/state.md` by documenting the successful completion of Session 5 (Architecture Alignment & Post-Reset Recovery). Captured key metrics including the 87-section count, the successful `npm run build` verification, and the current repository path.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Project metadata and session history are now fully accurate and reflect the current workstation environment.
- 🧪 Tests: none (metadata update).
- 📁 Files: Updated history/state/state.md.
- 🔁 Next prompts: Continue with development or final project handoff preparation.
- 🧠 Reflection: Maintaining the state.md file ensures that future AI agents or human developers have an immediate and accurate overview of the project's journey and current health.
